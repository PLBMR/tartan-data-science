3000 genderless observations, which accounted for most of the 1-time users.
    --Implication -> use two datasets, one for gender models and one for non-
    gender models

Naive Modelling:
    -Decision Tree of Gender on Latitude and Longitude Variables
        --Implication -> latitude and longitude are not saying much about the
            gender
    -Decision Tree of Customer on Latitude and Longitude Variables
        --Implication: Huge amount of interaction between these two variables
